# JWST-Torsion-Kernel-Paper
A three-parameter torsion-inspired kernel that captures a universal continuum curvature seen in JWST CEERS, PRIMER, UNCOVER, and JADES high-z spectra. Includes cosmological ρ(a) modulation, full statistical comparison (χ²/AIC/BIC), ablation tests, and reproducible notebooks. Preprint: arXiv:25xx.xxxxx
